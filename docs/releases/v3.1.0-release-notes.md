# Portfolio Fit v3.1.0 (Release Notes Draft)

## Highlights
- Multi-stack scoring maturity:
  - stack detection for Python backend / full-stack / Django templates / Node frontend
  - consistent applicability model (`known`, `unknown`, `not_applicable`)
- Extended full-stack engineering signals:
  - frontend quality
  - data layer quality
  - API contract maturity
  - full-stack maturity
- Stack-aware profile recalibration:
  - explicit `--stack-profile`
  - strict anti-mixing mode
  - label splitting by stack for reproducible recalibration
- CI reliability upgrade:
  - matrix smoke checks for 4 stack scenarios.

## Notable artifacts
- `tests/ci_smoke_stack_profiles.py`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (stack smoke matrix job)
- `docs/recalibration-profiles.md`
- `docs/migration-v3_0-to-v3_1.md`
- `schemas/portfolio_evaluation.schema.json`

## Compatibility
- CLI entrypoint remains `enhanced_evaluate_portfolio.py`.
- Existing report filenames remain unchanged.
- Schema remains backward-compatible for existing core fields.

## Operational notes
- For personal recalibration, avoid mixed-stack overlap in strict mode.
- Use `--stack-profile all` only when intentionally calibrating a mixed dataset.
