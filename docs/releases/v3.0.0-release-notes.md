# Portfolio Fit v3.0.0 (Release Notes Draft)

## Highlights
- Scoring pipeline stabilized with explicit evidence semantics:
  - `known/unknown`, `measured/heuristic`, `confidence`.
- Formal JSON output contract introduced:
  - schema generation + contract validator.
- Calibration stack expanded:
  - golden-set preparation, calibration reports, tuning patch generation.
- Profile-based recalibration introduced:
  - per-user calibration artifacts without overriding global baseline.
- Job Fit engine upgraded:
  - stricter skill detection,
  - better JD requirement parsing,
  - improved gap realism in benchmark output.

## Notable artifacts
- `schemas/portfolio_evaluation.schema.json`
- `generate_portfolio_schema.py`
- `validate_evaluation_contract.py`
- `recalibrate_profile.py`
- `docs/calibration-applicability-limits.md`

## Compatibility
- CLI entrypoint remains: `enhanced_evaluate_portfolio.py`
- JSON/TXT report filenames remain backward-compatible.

## Risk notes
- Tuning patches are profile-level by default.
- Global config override requires explicit operator action and compare-run validation.
